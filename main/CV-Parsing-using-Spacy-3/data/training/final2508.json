Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.

Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means.

Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.

Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means. We propose data allocation strategies across the agents that improve the probability of identifying leakages. These methods do not rely on alterations of the released data e.g., watermarks . some cases we can also inject realistic but fake data records to further improve our chances of detecting leakage and identifying the guilty party.\r", {"entities": [[1, 16, "NAME"], [90, 104, "PHONENO"], [111, 136, "EMAIL"], [137, 151, "DESIGNATION"], [545, 549, "SKILLS"], [563, 569, "SKILLS"], [572, 579, "SKILLS"], [581, 588, "SKILLS"], [590, 603, "SKILLS"], [627, 630, "SKILLS"], [952, 978, "HIGHEDUCATION"], [1302, 1306, "SKILLS"], [1308, 1317, "SKILLS"], [1319, 1321, "SKILLS"], [1403, 1409, "SKILLS"], [1411, 1414, "SKILLS"], [1443, 1447, "SKILLS"], [1449, 1460, "SKILLS"], [1724, 1731, "SKILLS"], [1733, 1734, "SKILLS"], [1735, 1739, "SKILLS"]]}], ["\fSanthosh Kumar Gunna Email santhoshkumargunna426@gmail.com Phone +91-7036247300 PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY Having 1 month experience in development of web based application ie -FMS ONLINE Good knowledge in C ,Asp.net,Asp.net Mvc, Sql Server Web Technolgies.

The fans group of a celebrity, his impaction value in the social network and the matching degree between the celebrity and the product are used to determine the most suitable celebrity in social network. The attribute similarities between the target customers and the fans of the celebrity are calculated via the Pearson similarity formula. Then, considering the impaction value of the celebrity and the matching degree of the celebrity and the product which can be accessed on the website or usually available from the enterprise, an evaluation index is proposed. We use some data from Fankick user interaction data show the effectiveness of our proposed matching recommendation algorithm. Moreover, the analysis shows that the products may be different which are endorsed by the same celebrity in and off the social network. Fankick is an intuitively designed, easy-to-use app that lets you restore your inner fan. The app allows you to stay connected to your favorite celebrity, with all their latest updates, news, and gossips. Browse through various categories that interest you from TV shows, music, movies, sports, and celebrities striking a fun cord with your answers.

All the invoices from the supplier need to be studied for pattern logic from OTP historic data to globally store the patterns for each supplier.Based on the historic data patterns, each new invoice needs to be checked against the historical database and anomalies on the pattern against the database need to be thrown for mismatched invoice pattern.The primary objective is to leverage the bank s Big Data platform EDMp to provide necessary tools and views to query data for Management Information MI and Business Intelligence BI purposes. The goal is to leverage Data as one of the means to identify risk, build and monitor KPIs, Improve operational efficiency and lower cost of service. Developing data processing tasks using Python such as reading data from external sources, merge data, perform data enrichment and load in to target data destinations. Hypercare BIF to SDM framework Migration Data Ingestion framework BIF was built for batch ingestion using map-reduce as processing engine for all operations and uses FALCON OOZIE for orchestration. Pre-processing was built using shell scripts, which manages the files to be processed and perform recon after processing. Since sourcing was done by different teams, the pre-processing was heavily customized to the source system behavior. Upgradation of Hadoop platform enabled us to leverage on the modern technology stack for faster processing with standard set of resources and reduce dependency on older tool set like FALCON OOZIE. Processing stack was finalized as HDF Hortonworks Data Flow NIFI for data pipeline and Spark which runs on HDP Hortonworks Data Platform as the processing engine.
