Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.

Developed the business code for Modules. Involved in creating Data Design Involved in connecting to the Database Configuration. Involved in Testing the Application code and analyze results. Description A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents third parties . Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means. We propose data allocation strategies across the agents that improve the probability of identifying leakages. These methods do not rely on alterations of the released data e.g., watermarks . some cases we can also inject realistic but fake data records to further improve our chances of detecting leakage and identifying the guilty party.\\r',\n",

Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.

Description A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents third parties . Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means. We propose data allocation strategies across the agents that improve the probability of identifying leakages. These methods do not rely on alterations of the released data e.g., watermarks . some cases we can also inject realistic but fake data records to further improve our chances of detecting leakage and identifying the guilty party.\\r',\n",

Description A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents third parties . Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means. We propose data allocation strategies across the agents that improve the probability of identifying leakages. These methods do not rely on alterations of the released data e.g., watermarks . some cases we can also inject realistic but fake data records to further improve our chances of detecting leakage and identifying the guilty party.\\r',\n",

Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.

Description A data distributor has given sensitive data to a set of supposedly trusted agents third parties . Some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place e.g., on the web or somebody s laptop . The distributor must assess the likelihood that the leaked data came from one or more agents, as opposed to having been independently gathered by other means. We propose data allocation strategies across the agents that improve the probability of identifying leakages. These methods do not rely on alterations of the released data e.g., watermarks . some cases we can also inject realistic but fake data records to further improve our chances of detecting leakage and identifying the guilty party.\\r',\n",

Environment DOT NET,My SQL database,HTML CSS.ACADEMIC PROJECT Project Title REAL TIME SMART CITY GARBAGE COLLECTION AND AIR POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING GSM Abstract In the recent decades, urbanization has increased tremendously. At the same phase there is an increase in waste production. In the present scenario, the waste management includes numerous stages with tremendous man-power. Every time labourers have to visit the garbage bins in the city area to check whether they are filled or not. And if they are filled, garbage bins are collected and disposed at closest landfill. If garbage bins are not filled, then the man-power invested goes in vain. Sometimes, the garbage bins are more frequently filled and garbage remains unattended for a longer period due to lack of management. Thus the garbage bins get overflowed which in turn create unhygienic condition for the people and also result in bad smell around the surroundings and spreading of some deadly diseases. This project automates the whole process by monitoring level and status toxic gases that get release of the garbage present in bins by using various sensors and the information is collected from these sensors and is sent to the municipal authorities with the help of a microcontroller by using GSM. This will drastically reduce the wastage of man-power and even reduce the overflow of garbage bins. This system would also enable us to collect garbage only from those places that are about to overflow. Thus, this proposed system contributes to clean and hygienic environment.
